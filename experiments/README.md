Note
====
Each program is in it's separate directory with a Makefile. The additional required library (apart from OpenGL 3.0 and higher) as of now is Eigen math library. If your Eigen location is different, change it accordingly in the required makefile.

Compiling
=========
If you have copied this directory as it is, just go to the program directory of your choice and type 'make'. Then type './program_name' to run the executable.
